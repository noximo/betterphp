This site aims to collect articles, blog posts, videos, twitter threads etc. from various sources that deal with PHP development.

It would be great if you could share some of those links you have stored in your bookmarks for future reference! 

Just hit me at [@noximo](https://twitter.com/noximo) or create an issue/pull request at [https://github.com/noximo/betterphp](https://github.com/noximo/betterphp)

What I'm looking for? An articles that can make you a better PHP developer or a better programmer in general, not articles that covers the basics. Though that's often a matter of perspective and opinion so this is gonna be opinionated collection. 

What I'm not looking for? Articles that deals with specific problems or framework specifc stuff, articles relevant only for short amount of time (new version release etc.)
